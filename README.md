a site from the online course
an address for the online course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-flexbox-grid-sass-animations-developer-course/
Please note the author of the course uses some horrible practices like  selection by ID in CSS, using `let` instead of `const` a way to long html and css files etc. I've tired to fix it where possible, or just leave a comment that some not reasonable selection was done due studying purposes.

I've also ommited minification of the .css files by intention in order to make the review via borwsers a bit simplier.

How to use: just clone, go to the "up" folder and run index.html.
You'll probably gonna need the live SASS compiler as an extion to VS.code (once you use VS.code) https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass
Please look for another extension for you code editor or IDE if it it's not VS.code
